# Weather-Journal App Project
This is my 3rd project as part of the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Program.
## Overview
For this project I created an asynchronous web app that uses a Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.
Users can enter their location followed by how they feel and then the API retrieves the weather for that specific location and outputs it alongside the date and the users information about how they feel. 

This was developed using Javascript, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, ExpressJS and Open Weather Map API.
